How to play

- play as one of the 154 characters currently in the game
- Destroy the enemy team's nexus, located in their base before they destroy yours
- destroy all defense structures (turrets) that are blocking the lanes
- get power ups by buying items, with gold you get from killing minions, monsters, or the enemy characters
